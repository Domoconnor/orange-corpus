##Sketches

To generate and combine ideas for our forms of data visualisation, we individually produced sketches. These sketches consisted of different formats of visualisation; ranging from the more technical approach of graphs and charts, to ambient forms of colour systems and "heatmaps".  

###Iteration 1

####Five-Sketches-or-Else Method

Our initial sketching phase, the **"5 sketches or else"** method, involved us each individually producing 5 different sketches of our proposed data visualisation. This was to be done in isolation of one another, preventing individual ideas from clashing with the opinions of others, and to promote unique designs amongst group members. 

We set out to design easy, straight forward ways to show data that our sensors had gathered. This premise inspired us to produce simple designs which weren't over complicated, but also ones that weren't limited by specific requirements. This allowed us to express some creative freedom in the process, and produce some interesting designs. 

**Here are our outcomes of the Five-Sketches-or-Else Method:** 

These initial sketches were drawn in pencil, and explored an open ended approach to data visualisation. They were comprised of several unique ideas; varying from typical graph formats, to looking at specific formatting for devices and tablets.

	Sketch 1 - Sensor visualisation. This design focuses on highlighting the location that was most noisy. This was based upon the position of the dot, providing coverage over the course of a day.

	Sketch 2 - Scatter graph sensor visualisation. This provides a more technical overview, plotting data of specific volume values for each sensor.

![sketch 3](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_3.jpeg)

	Sketch 3 - Unique approach to graphing noise volume against time.
 
![sketch 4](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_4.jpeg)

	Sketch 4 - 3D graph view. 

![sketch 5](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_5.jpeg)

	Sketch 5 - Data visualisation on iOS devices.

From these sketches onwards, more of an emphasis to colour visualisation is made, drawing inspiration from colour systems to convey data.

	Sketch 6 - Simple daily bar chart view

![sketch 7](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_2.png)

	Sketch 7 - Clock display. This is a more novel approach to data visualisation, and uses a clock to plot sound averages as segments. 

![sketch 8](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_3.png)

	Sketch 8 - Monthly sound average view. 

![sketch 9](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_4.png)

	Sketch 9 - Side by side view of critical noise periods against normal periods.

![sketch 10](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_5.png)

	Sketch 10 - Interchangeable bar chart and line graph view. Offers two different views of data, which can be altered according to user preference.

![sketch 11](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_6.png)

	Sketch 11 - Line graph plot of average noise, current noise, and previous month's average.

![sketch 12](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_7.png)

	Sketch 12 - Histogram view of normal sound levels vs current sound levels.

![sketch 13](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_8.png)

	Sketch 13 - Heatmap view - another novel form of visualisation, this is a map of Orange street which is coloured according to noise "hotspots". Used to provide granularity between quieter and noisier areas, and pinpoint disturbances.

![sketch 14](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_9.png)

	Sketch 14 - Line graph and colour coded display - intended to establish sound "thresholds", which clearly indicate to the user when the noise level has crossed a certain boundary. 

![sketch 15](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_10.png)

	Sketch 15 - Calendar view - A combination of the clock view with a daily/weekly/monthly comparison chart.

####Outcome of Iteration
During this iteration, we began to develop our data visualisation platform. We considered individual approaches to visualising sound data; incorporating trusted forms of display such as graphs, diagrams, and chart, as well as experimenting with new, less common ideas. As a result of these experiments, we approached our data visualisation creatively, creating a wide range of possibilities for what we finally provide to our client. 

After this iteration, we have set up a platform to build upon for our data visualisation. We can now look into combining ideas to come up with more dynamic concepts. 

####Iteration 2

####Combined Sketches 
Once we had each individually developed five sketches, we shared them, and collaborated ideas behind our chosen data formats. This lead to crossovers in ideas, and common themes and designs behind ideas were identified. 

In this phase, we focused on combining our ideas and extending the functionality of our existing designs. As a result, our sketches became more specific, and we began to consider how realistically they could be implemented. 

The focus here, was placed upon what forms of visualisation the client would find most useful. We held onto some of our novel ideas, such as **the clock**, and further developed them alongside other means. 

**Here are our outcomes of the Combined Sketches Method:**

![combined sketch 1](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_comb_1.jpeg)

	Combined sketch 1 - Histogram crossed with noise threshold.

![combined sketch 2](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_comb_2.jpeg)

	Combined sketch 2 - Graph and clock view - incorporates a clock view to display user, and shows the relative sound level at each time interval.

![combined sketch 3](Images/Sketch%20Images/Matt_comb_3.jpeg)

	Combined sketch 3 - Sensor and decibel level view - combines the ideas of having a sensor centric visualisation which pinpoints activity, and a decibel scaling system.

![combined sketch 4](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_comb_1.png)

	Combined sketch 4 - Heatmap and graph visualisation - this sketch integrates the novel approach of the street heatmap with a line graph to reinforce the data.

![combined sketch 5](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_comb_2.png)

	Combined sketch 5 - Threshold graph comparison - designed to give the user to ability to compare several different dates in terms of sound thresholds that were crossed. 

![combined sketch 6](Images/Sketch%20Images/Jack_comb_3.png)

	Combined sketch 6 - Touch screen / tablet heatmap view. Adds the extra detail of a colour based averaging system to the heatmap, and implements it for a touchscreen device. 

![combined sketch 7](Images/Sketch%20Images/Dan_1.png)

	Combined sketch 7 - Graphical sensor comparison. This visualisation provides a time scale on the X axis, and the ability to add series from different sensors. 

![combined sketch 8](Images/Sketch%20Images/Dan_2.png)

	Combined sketch 8 - Sensor map view - incorporates a variable time system with a sensor map, where the user can view sensor activity according to their desired time parameters. 

![combined sketch 9](Images/Sketch%20Images/Dan_3.png)

	Combined sketch 9 - Coloured time chart - a colourful approach to visualisation, this sketch creates a coloured sound scaling system, and plots its as a grid. Useful for daily comparisons, and averaging sound activity over time in easily interpreted formats. 

####Outcome of Iteration
During our second iteration of sketching, we have developed upon our existing bank of data visualisation ideas, and been more conscious in our approach of realistic data formats. This iteration has featured a much more colour oriented approach; drawing more upon ambient visual aids to create signposting for the user. The fidelity of the designs has resultantly increased, and ideas have become more amalgamated together, and specific to the client's needs. 

A recurring theme for visualisation during this iteration has been time, and how our system can use it to generate comparable data. It is concluded that time plays a large role in our system; especially since one of the major requirements is to have comparable data between dates. 

###Iteration 3

####Balsamiq, and Interface Mockups

Before we implemented our front end visualisation, it was important to explore different layouts and styles, which could then be translated into code. To do this, we used the lightweight mockup tool, **Balsamiq**, the create several different design mockups. These mockups were intended to simulate our various data platforms, by visualising website and application layouts, and having charts and diagrams to show how our visualisation would work in these contexts. 

In these designs, we aimed to produce easily interpretable interfaces which focus purely on visualisation. We wanted to remove any other distractions from the user, and draw their attention to the main priority: their data. 

To do this, our designs are minimalistic, and implement easily graspable layouts and methods of navigation. There is opportunity to further develop upon these simplistic designs at later points, but these designs capture the essential details. 

**Here are the outcomes of our Balsamiq designs:**
