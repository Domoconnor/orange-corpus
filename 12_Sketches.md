##Sketches

To generate and combine ideas for our forms of data visualisation, we individually produced sketches. These sketches consisted of different formats of visualisation; ranging from the more technical approach of graphs and charts, to ambient forms of colour systems and "heatmaps".  

###Iteration 1

####Five-Sketches-or-Else Method

Our initial sketching phase, the **"5 sketches or else"** method, involved us each individually producing 5 different sketches of our proposed data visualisation. This was to be done in isolation of one another, preventing individual ideas from clashing with the opinions of others, and to promote unique designs amongst group members. 

We set out to design easy, straight forward ways to show data that our sensors had gathered. This premise inspired us to produce simple designs which weren't over complicated, but also ones that weren't limited by specific requirements. This allowed us to express some creative freedom in the process, and produce some interesting designs. 

**Here are our outcomes of the Five-Sketches-or-Else Method:** 

These initial sketches were drawn in pencil, and explored an open ended approach to data visualisation. They were comprised of several unique ideas; varying from typical graph formats, to looking at specific formatting for devices and tablets.

	Sketch 1 - Sensor visualisation. This design focuses on highlighting the location that was most noisy. This was based upon the position of the dot, providing coverage over the course of a day.

	Sketch 2 - Scatter graph sensor visualisation. This provides a more technical overview, plotting data of specific volume values for each sensor.

####Outcome of Iteration
During this iteration, we began to develop our data visualisation platform. We considered individual approaches to visualising sound data; incorporating trusted forms of display such as graphs, diagrams, and chart, as well as experimenting with new, less common ideas. As a result of these experiments, we approached our data visualisation creatively, creating a wide range of possibilities for what we finally provide to our client. 

After this iteration, we have set up a platform to build upon for our data visualisation. We can now look into combining ideas to come up with more dynamic concepts. 

####Iteration 2

####Combined Sketches 
Once we had each individually developed five sketches, we shared them, and collaborated ideas behind our chosen data formats. This lead to crossovers in ideas, and common themes and designs behind ideas were identified. 

In this phase, we focused on combining our ideas and extending the functionality of our existing designs. As a result, our sketches became more specific, and we began to consider how realistically they could be implemented. 

The focus here, was placed upon what forms of visualisation the client would find most useful. We held onto some of our novel ideas, such as **the clock**, and further developed them alongside other means. 

**Here are our outcomes of the Combined Sketches Method:**
