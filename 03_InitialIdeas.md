###Initial Ideas

At this point we had spoken to enough individuals to have a good place to start working on a potential prototype. We needed to plan how we would efficiently tackle the problem ahead of us. We first had to make a list of requirements based on our aims <span class="todo">link to aims</span>

* We needed multiple sensors 
* We needed the sensors to be self-sustainable for a long period of time.
* We needed the sensors to be out of the way but effective (Out of mind, not reminders to the clients), so no wires running everywhere.
* We needed a way to visualise all the data from these sensors into a form that was easily understandable
* We needed control over the network, and ideally a way to configure it.
* We needed cases that could ensure the endurance of the devices in different conditions.

Translating this to a solution we can work with:

* We were looking at some form of wireless solution, we could not afford to have wires running everywhere when the clients wanted the solution ‘out of mind’. With wireless comes many different solutions, we investigated the best options available to us.
* We know we had to sample sound - we did not know how often to sample however so we went to investigate that also.
* A microphone is needed with any other electronic circuitry that comes with it. 
* A way to display this data, we decided to investigate ways to do such a thing.
* We had to ensure some form of data backup also.
* Some of the requested locations for these sensors were completely unreachable by permanent power supplies, which led us to the investigation of long term battery solutions.
* We needed a case that could survive harsh weather and conditions, one that would be of a suitable Ingress Protection Rating.
