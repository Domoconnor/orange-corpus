##Manufacture / Casing [cont.](#contents)

###Initial Research

The project required us to have hardware in the real world meaning that it has to be able to survive in the environment that it is deployed in. We couldn't simply deploy the electronics because they would get damaged. Therefor we have to house all of our pieces of hardware in some form of casing.

There are a few ways to make cases, they include making a custom 3D model of the object and sending it to companies to either be 3D printed, a process where plastic is melted and printed in layers to form the intended 3 dimensional object. Alternatively, injection moulding, a process where a mould is made of the object intended to be created then melted plastic fills the negative space in the mould leaving the object when it has hardened. 

Injection moulding creates a rigid plastic shell when hardened as the piece comes from liquid plastic that hardens into one piece whereas 3D printed pieces can be more brittle as the plastic dries on when each layer is added meaning it can leave pores on the final product.

There are companies that offer custom 3D printing and injection moulding such as [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) (3D printing) and [Protolabs](http://www.protolabs.co.uk/) (3D printing and injection moulding). The main issues with these places is the cost and time it would take to get an object back. We would have to design the object we want created, each piece is individually quoted, it would be created and we would have to wait for it to arrive. In the case of injection moulding Protolabs have a minimum of 25 parts from one mould, meaning it would be more expensive than 3D printing. If there was a mistake in a 3D model we would have wasted time and money and still have to print another one.

Although, The Shed has specific software for 3D modelling and a 3D printer that we can use for prototyping and final printing of our cases. It is possible to quickly print a prototype and test a design multiple times and print a final when we are happy with it. 

####Conclusion

We decided to use the Sheds facilities to create our cases. It will be much more cost efficient as we do not have to pay for each individual print and the turn around of each piece is much quick as we do not have to wait for it to be posted.

###Hub Case

####Description

The Hub case is 3D printed. It was designed to hold the Raspberry Pi in place through the use of screws and nuts. It is also designed in a manner that made it easy to open incase there were any problems while the hub was deployed. The case comes in two parts, the lid and the base.

The case is meant to be easily modifiable. So that if there are any changes that need to be made it is easy enough to change the 3D model and print off a new one that fits the purpose better.

*Base*

The base is made to be 2mm thick on the longer sides for strength and rigidity. It was made to be slightly bigger than the Raspberry Pi model B+ (5mm in every direction but the one with the ethernet connection). It has holes in the bottom big enough for 2.5mm fixings to fit through both the case and the board using nuts to hold it in place so that the board is secure inside.

There are two grooves on the longer sides of the base, inside the base, that allow the lid to click into place.

*Lid* 

The lid is designed to be reversible for ease of use. The longer sides of the lid has sections that sit inside the base. These sections are as long as the inside of the base so that it does not slide around when fitted. These extruded sections have further extruded lines that click into the grooves on the base. To remove the lid squeeze the sides and pull off. It was designed in this way for ease of access.

#####Iteration 1 - Initial Hub Base.

The FRDM K64F board had no technical specifications that could be found meaning we did not have the measurements for it. Therefore it had to be measured by eye using rulers and electronic calipers. 

INSERT INITIAL SKETCH

As this is the fist time we would be 3D printing anything we had no reference for how strong the result would be. We decided to measure the thickness of the calipers box as that seemed to be quite a strong (2.5mm).

We decided to model the bottom half of the case first. This was done because it was the smaller of the two pieces of the case, we could reprint a new one quickly if there was anything wrong with this one. We wanted the board to be secure in the case so the we designed it in a way that the base, lid and board had holes that lined up so 3mm fixings could be screwed through all three and secured together.

######Outcomes of iteration

We 3D printed our first object, learnt how to use the software properly.
