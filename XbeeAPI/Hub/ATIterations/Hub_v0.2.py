# Try to send via post
# If failed, receive then save on disk
# Next attempt try to send again
# Each time data is sent request latest average
# Send average to Jack

# Clock messages
# -2 Means that there is no average for this hour
# -3 Means unable to connect to the server

# Testing...
# Test sensor sending data to hub and forwarding onwards
# Test clock asking for hour to hub and hub asking server and backpedaling to clock
# Test failing to reach server and sending clock -3
# Test failing to reach server and sending updated post payload
# Test failing to reach server but connection reestablished
# Test concat sensor data from file
# Test splitting by \n

# When receiving data from GET should ONLY be the value and nothing else
# No fancy bits, just a blank page and the response in text for the script to scrub

# Start up details are in /etc/rc.local 
# Much use 'which' command to determine absolute location of commands/scripts
# Also access as root aka sudo
