##Client Interaction 
[Back to contents.](#contents)

###Aims
Our client interaction brought to light these main issues to consider in our project. 

**They do not want to think about the noise:**   
The user talked a lot about having to worry about remembering specific times they were caused inconvenience by the noise outside and then provide evidence of those inconveniences. Therefore the project needs to store data and visualise it in a way that could be presented as evidence of their inconvenience. Also from this we can gather that the user does not really want any real interaction with the device as it would mean them thinking about the noise. The point of the device should be that it runs autonomously (to create peace of mind for the user) collecting data for the user to visualise and use as evidence at their discretion.

**Solution needs little to no interaction, running in the background:**  
The user expects the device to have a maintenance level of a device akin to a router. They expect some general maintenance but they do not want to be too involved with it, ie worrying about battery life all the time.

**A long term solution:**  
Along the lines of the other two themes before, the user wanted the system to be robust and sustainable. During the meeting the user said that this year so far wasn't as bad as last and didn't want to complain this year if it was to change next and get worse. Therefore the end result of the project should be something that the user can maintain on their own.

**People should be aware of their own noise levels:**  
The client talked a lot about wanting the people in the street to know how noisy they are being. Points being brought up suggesting signs that had the decibel reading on them so that people can visualise the noise like a road sign that turns on when you are going too fast. Although, as we wouldn't be able to enforce the sound level it could possibly encouraging even challenging people in the street to be loud to try and make the sign go off.

####Meeting ONE

We had to speak with the clients before we started to formulate a solution. We had to know what they wanted, so that we could make a solution that best filled their needs. To prepare for this we researched proper interviewing techniques by reading: *“Interviewing users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights (Steve Portigal, 2013)”*.  

The main lesson we took from the Portigal book was that we needed to let the client talk. We did not want to steer their answers in any direction. We organised roles amongst ourselves, with a leader asking questions and the rest taking notes. If the note takers had any questions we made sure they were asked at the end of the question so that the client did not lose track.

Our intended outcome for this meeting was to have an incite into our clients perception of the problem they are having, whereby we can devise a method in which to solve said problem. We had an idea of the client's problem before we went into the meeting, based on what we were told in the project brief. Therefore, in preparation we made a list of questions that we felt we needed answered to gain a better understanding. We then trimmed down our question list intending to allow our client to talk as freely as possible. 

All recordings, notes and questions from the meeting can be found [here](meeting_one/)
####Meeting TWO

We spoke to another client that was meant to be present at the original meeting but was unable to make it. They are a landlord of Orange Street tenants living next to a popular club called ‘The Ballroom’. In this meeting we followed the same layout as set in the first meeting, making one person take the lead and the others taking notes, we also followed the same structure of questions.

####Other Communication

We also tried to speak to other people, pubs and bars in the area to try and gain a greater understanding of the issues that were present in the street and what people were doing to try and solve them.  

A message was sent out to three of the main purported culprits of noise on the street: The Maori Bar, The Seven Stars and Ballroom. The message said: 
>Hello, three other Kent students and I have undertaken a project whereby we are looking into sound around Orange Street. We were wondering how you deal with sound i.e. keeping it contained or if there is a way you try and stop it from spilling into the street. 
>
>Thank you  

The Maori Bar responded with: 
>Hello Matthew thanks for your message, our building is soundproofed in the walls and we make sure the door is kept shut so to trap and muffle as much of the sound as possible. We also monitor our sound levels regularly with a decibel reader.  
>
>Orange Street is a very busy street especially on a Friday and Saturday night and attracts a lot of foot traffic. Of course telling people to keep quiet is near enough impossible as they pass between venues. We don't have live music or DJ's but The Seven Stars and The Ballroom do. We are a small venue with only about 40 people in at one time on average. We would be interested in your findings in your project. Keep us posted.
>
>The Maori Bar team.

This shows that there is an awareness that the street is loud but it can be hard to police outside of the venue. It was also interesting that they mentioned keeping the door closed as the door being opened and closed with the occasional noise leaking out was cited as a large source of annoyance by the clients.  

The Seven Stars allowed us to come and talk to a manager. They said they maintain the noise by trying to keep the doors and windows shut as much as possible and they have a set of double doors so that the sound is muffled when people are coming and going. They also said that they had decibel readers that they checked to make sure that the inside noise was in accordance with the set sound levels. They know that people are noisy when they leave the establishment but he said there was nothing that could be done about that as it is a problem that comes with the clientele.  

Unfortunately The Ballroom did not get back to us.  

####Noise Law

We looked into noise laws. We did this so that we could understand, firstly, if the way we were collecting data was legal and to see if the data we provide to the client would be of any use to them.  

The main thing we found were that there are noise laws in place but they only apply to residential premises according to the ***Noise Act 1996 - Non commercial only. This law only relates to noise that is coming from a residential premises such as neighbours, it does not affect licensed premises.***  

We also found that police can close a premises based on the ***161 Closure orders for identified premises - (1) A senior police officer may make a closure order in relation to any relevant premises if he reasonably believes that: (a) there is, or is likely imminently to be, disorder on, or in the vicinity of and related to, the premises and their closure is necessary in the interests of public safety, or  (b) a public nuisance is being caused by noise coming from the premises and the closure of the premises is necessary to prevent that nuisance.***

The following email is from the Environmental Health department of Canterbury County Council. This is the department that handles any noise complaints regarding both residential and commercial premises. We enquired to them about noise laws.

>Dom

>In response to your enquiry each premises is based on its own merits, hours of operation and location so we don’t have any set levels for Canterbury District. Two documents which may be of use to you are the Control of Noise at Work  
>
>Regulations 2005 which deals with operators requirements for their staff and BS:4142
>  
>The Method for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound - this looks at how and where to measure sound in mixed residential and business communities. I hope this helps  
>
>Tricia  

The first document mentioned is in relation to the noise levels that are acceptable for their staff and people working on the premises rather than those sounds that are heard from outside the premises so this is of less of a concern to us. Although, it can still be found [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1643/contents/made). 

The other document mentioned is owned by the British Standards Institute and incurs a cost if we wish to use it. A brief description of the document said the standard is used by the council and describes methods for rating and assessing:

* Helps assess sound levels at proposed new residential premises 
* Enables the investigation of complaints by determining sound levels 
* Reduces the likelihood of financial penalties 
* Supports current UK planning guidance and Environment Agency guidance sound of industrial or commercial nature.

We also looked into licensing reviews and found that anyone with evidence suggesting there is a problem can request a licence review from the council as long as it comes under one of the following:

* Crime and/or disorder 
* Public nuisance 
* Public Safety 
* Prevention of harm to children

In this case, the noise generated from the pubs and or clubs would be classed as a nuisance. 

When making a review request evidence needs to be provided to support the case that you are making. This evidence can be in multiple forms such as:

* a diary or record of events or incidents 
* photos or video evidence
* sound recordings
* a record of complaints made to the responsible authorities about the premise
